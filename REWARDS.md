# StackOdds Rewards System

This document outlines how rewards are calculated and distributed within the StackOdds ecosystem. Our goal is to incentivize active participation, technical contribution, and ecosystem growth.

## Reward Calculation

**How are rewards calculated?**

Rewards are based on your leaderboard position, which is determined by your activity across:

• The activity and impact of the smart contracts you’ve deployed on Stacks

• Use of `@stacks/connect` and `@stacks/transactions` in your repos

• GitHub contributions to public repositories

## Scoring Breakdown

### 1. Smart Contract Activity (40%)
Impact is measured by:
- Number of unique users interacting with your contracts.
- Total transaction volume processed by your contracts.
- Complexity and utility of the Clarity code.

### 2. Integration Depth (30%)
We reward developers who build on top of our primitives:
- Active use of `@stacks/connect` for authentication.
- Robust transaction handling via `@stacks/transactions`.
- Implementation of post-conditions for user security.

### 3. Community & Open Source (30%)
GitHub contributions are vital for the Stacks ecosystem:
- Meaningful PRs to public Stacks-related repositories.
- Maintenance of developer tools and libraries.
- Documentation improvements and tutorials.

## Distribution Schedule
Rewards are calculated weekly and distributed every Monday at 12:00 UTC. Users can track their current standing on the [Leaderboard](/rewards).
